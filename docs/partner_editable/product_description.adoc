Cassandra is an open-source, scalable, active-everywhere NoSQL database used by the internetâ€™s largest applications. Cassandra is the only NoSQL database with a masterless architecture enabling zero downtime, zero lock-in, and global scale for data sovereignty.

Cassandra for AWS gives users and enterprises a deployment process based on cloud best practices to quickly install an Cassandra cluster on AWS in a single Region across multiple zones.

Each cluster also includes a virtual machine (VM) that provides a complete set of development resources, including code examples, documentation, and data integration tools.

Optionally, DataStax Luna provides subscription-based support for open-source Cassandra on AWS. DataStax Luna subscribers get the benefits of open-source software and direct access to the engineers who authored most of Cassandra's code and provide support for some of the largest Cassandra deployments.
