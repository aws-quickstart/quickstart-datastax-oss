==== Prepare your AWS account

If you don’t already have an AWS account, create one at
https://aws.amazon.com by following the on-screen instructions. Part of
the sign-up process involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN
using the phone keypad.
Use the region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region
where you want to deploy the Quick Start on AWS.

*Choosing an AWS Region*

[TIP]
Consider choosing a region closest to your data center or
corporate network to reduce network latency between systems running on
AWS and the systems and users on your corporate network.

Also, note that your choice of region will determine whether the Quick
Start deploys NAT gateways or NAT instances for network connections. For
a list of regions that support NAT gateways, see
http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/[Amazon VPC pricing].

Create a http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[key
pair] in your preferred region. To do this, in the navigation pane of
the Amazon EC2 console, choose *Key Pairs*, *Create Key Pair*, type a
name, and then choose *Create*.

*Creating a key pair*

Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login
information. To be able to log in to your instances, you must create a
key pair. With Windows instances, we use the key pair to obtain the
administrator password via the Amazon EC2 console and then log in using
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as explained in the
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair[step-by-step
instructions] in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_. On
Linux, we use the key pair to authenticate SSH login.

==== Prepare your {partner-company-name} account

*Optional* - Create a free account in https://academy.datastax.com[DataStax Academy] for Apache Cassandra certification resources, courses and role based learning paths.

==== Prepare for the deployment

_Describe any preparation required to complete the product build, such as obtaining licenses or placing files in S3_
