This Quick Start deployment guide was created by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in partnership with DataStax, Inc.

# Overview

This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying DataStax Distribution of Apache Cassandra (DDAC) on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

As Apache Cassandra™ adoption grows within your organization, so could the challenges involved with using, maintaining, and supporting the technology. This can add considerable cost, complexity, and administrative burden. DataStax Distribution of Apache Cassandra addresses these challenges by streamlining operations and controlling costs for all your Cassandra workloads.

You’ll have access to best-in-class, 100% open source compatible Cassandra software, as well as support and services from the experts that authored the majority of the Cassandra code.

[Quick Starts](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/?quickstart-all.q=dse) are automated reference deployments that use AWS CloudFormation templates to launch, configure, and run the AWS compute, network, storage, and other services required to deploy a specific workload on AWS.

This Quick Start is for users who need an easily deployed DDAC cluster for development and or testing purposes

## Costs and Licenses

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional cost for using the Quick Start.

The AWS CloudFormation template for this Quick Start includes configuration parameters that you can customize. Some of these settings, such as instance type, will affect the cost of deployment. For cost estimates, see the pricing pages for each AWS service you will be using.

This Quick Start includes a limited no-fee license from DataStax. As described in section 1.4 of [DataStax Enterprise Terms](http://www.datastax.com/enterprise-terms), the limited license is for development or non-production use.  To use the Quick Start to build a production environment, you&#39;ll need to acquire a DataStax subscription license.
&nbsp;

# Architecture

Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with **default parameters** builds the following DataStax Enterprise environment in the AWS Cloud.

![Figure 1](./assets/arch.png)

<p align=center><b>Figure 1: Quick Start architecture for DDAC on AWS</b></p>

The Quick Start sets up the following components. (The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks.)

- A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.\*
- A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS. For more information about the VPC infrastructure, see the [Amazon VPC Quick Start](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/vpc/).\*
- An Internet gateway to allow access to the Internet.\*
- Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound Internet access for resources in the private subnets.\*
- One EC2 instance in the public subnet running devOps apps, which can also be used as a jumpbox to ssh into DDAC nodes in the private subnet.
- Additional EC2 instances for DDAC nodes, depending on your Quick Start parameter settings. (By default, the Quick Start creates 3 DDAC nodes in private subnets (seednode1, seednode2 and an autoscaling group with 1 node) and can be expanded to a max of 6 nodes.
- One Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) data volume per node instance deployed.

## DDAC Data Centers and Nodes

DDAC data centers are groups of nodes, related and configured within a cluster for replication purposes. The Quick Start supports 1 data center  with 3 nodes that can scale to 6.

DDAC stores data replicas on multiple nodes to ensure reliability and fault tolerance. A replication strategy determines the nodes where replicas are placed. The replication strategy is defined per keyspace, and is set during keyspace creation. This Quick Start places nodes in each AWS Availability Zone.
&nbsp;

# Prerequisites

## Specialized Knowledge

Before you deploy this Quick Start, we recommend that you become familiar with the following AWS services. (If you are new to AWS, see [Getting Started with AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/awsgsg-intro/intro.html).)

- [Amazon VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/vpc/)
- [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ec2/)
- [Amazon EBS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html)

We also recommend that you become familiar with the features and configuration of Apache Cassandra.

- [DDAC documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/ddac/doc/)

## Technical Requirements

This Quick Start uses a Linux AMI (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) for EC2 instances, and creates EBS volumes and an S3 bucket. The account you run this Quick Start in must have authorization to create these resources.

# Deployment Options

This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

- **Deploy DDAC into a new VPC** (end-to-end deployment). This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, and other infrastructure components, and then deploys DDAC cluster into this new VPC.
- **Deploy DDAC into an existing VPC**. This option provisions DDAC cluster in your existing AWS VPC infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure CIDR blocks, instance types, and DDAC settings, as discussed later in this guide.
&nbsp;

# Deployment Steps

## Step 1. Prepare Your AWS Account

1. If you don&#39;t already have an AWS account, create one at [https://aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) by following the on-screen instructions.
2. Use the region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region where you want to deploy DDAC on AWS.
3. Create a [key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in your preferred region.
4. If necessary, [request a service limit increase](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&amp;limitType=service-code-) for the Amazon EC2 **m4.large** instance type. You might need to do this if you already have an existing deployment that uses this instance type, and you think you might exceed the [default limit](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html) with this reference deployment.

## Step 2. Launch the Quick Start

> **Note**    You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional cost for using this Quick Start. For full details, see the pricing pages for each AWS service you will be using in this Quick Start. Prices are subject to change.

1. Choose one of the following options to launch the AWS CloudFormation template into your AWS account. For help choosing an option, see deployment options earlier in this guide.

| Option 1 - Deploy DDAC into a new VPC on AWS | Option 2 - Deploy DDAC into an existing VPC on AWS |
| :------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------: |
|        [Launch](https://fwd.aws/mR5pP)       |           [Launch](https://fwd.aws/eq4AJ)          |

> **Important**     If you&#39;re deploying DDAC into an existing VPC, make sure that your VPC has two (and preferably three) private subnets in different Availability Zones for the node instances. These subnets require [NAT gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) or [NAT instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html) in their route tables, to allow the instances to download packages and software without exposing them to the Internet. You&#39;ll also need the domain name option configured in the DHCP options, as explained in the [Amazon VPC documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html). You&#39;ll be prompted for your VPC settings when you launch the Quick Start.

Each deployment takes about 10-15 minutes to complete, depending on the size of the DDAC cluster to deploy.

1. Check the region that&#39;s displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary. This is where the network infrastructure for DDAC will be built. The template is launched in the US East (Ohio) Region by default.
2. On the **Select Template** page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose **Next**.
3. On the **Specify Details** page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary. When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose **Next**.

In the following tables, parameters are listed by category and described separately for the two deployment options. Parameters for deploying DDAC into a new VPC and Parameters for deploying DDAC into an existing VPC

1. On the **Options** page, you can [specify tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html) (key-value pairs) for resources in your stack and [set advanced options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html). When you&#39;re done, choose **Next**.
2. On the **Review** page, review and confirm the template settings. Under **Capabilities** , select the check box to acknowledge that the template will create IAM resources.
3. Choose **Create** to deploy the stack.
4. Monitor the status of the stack.

This deployment uses nested stacks. In addition to the root stack, you&#39;ll see a VPC stack (if you choose to deploy the Quick Start into a new VPC), a DSE OpsCenter stack and one or more data center stacks. When the status of the root stack is **CREATE\_COMPLETE** , the installation of DDAC Cluster is complete, all node instances have been created, and DDAC Cluster is ready.

1. Use the _DDACUrl_ displayed in the **Outputs** tab for the stack to view the DDAC developer resource site.

![DDAC Url](./assets/ddac-stack-output-ddac-url.png)

> **Important:** We recommend deployment into a new VPC (Option 1). For production environments, we recommend that you place the cluster in private subnet (CreateClusterWithPublicIP=false).

## Step 3. Test the Deployment

After you deploy the DDAC cluster, the quickest way to begin using the cluster is to use SSH to connect to the DevOps instance and then to one of the node instances. You can use [SSH agent forwarding](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/securely-connect-to-linux-instances-running-in-a-private-amazon-vpc/) using the key pair (replacing the KEY_FILE and DevIpAddress values for those of your cluster):

You can get the ip addresses of the nodes from the output tab of the stack.

![Figure 3](./assets/ddac-stack-output-dev.png)

~~~shell
ssh -i $KEY_FILE ubuntu@$DevIpAddress
~~~

You can get the Seed1PrivateIpAddress from the output tab of the stack.

![Figure 3](./assets/ddac-stack-output-seed1.png)

Once logged into the DevOps instance, run

~~~shell
ssh -i $KEY_FILE ubuntu@$Seed1PrivateIpAddress
~~~

You can then view the status of the DDAC Cluster:
~~~shell
~$ nodetool status
~~~

For the default 3 node cluster, the nodetool status should be like

![nodetool-status](./assets/nodetool_status.png)

The Developer resource web site is accessible at DDACUrl shown in the outputs.

## Step 4. Back up Your Data

DDAC backs up data by taking a snapshot of all on-disk data files (SSTable files) stored in the data directory. You can take a snapshot of all keyspaces, a single keyspace, or a single table while the system is online. See [Backing up and Restoring data](https://docs.datastax.com/en/ddac/doc/datastax_enterprise/operations/opsBackupRestoreTOC.html).
For storing the backups in AWS S3, see [Backup to S3](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/backup-to-s3-cli/)
&nbsp;

# Troubleshooting

**Q.** I encountered a CREATE\_FAILED error when I launched the Quick Start. What should I do?

**A.** If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with **Rollback on failure** set to **No**. (This setting is under **Advanced** in the AWS CloudFormation console, **Options** page.) With this setting, the stack&#39;s state will be retained and the instance will be left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (You&#39;ll want to look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)

> **Important**   When you set **Rollback on failure** to **No** , you&#39;ll continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you&#39;ve finished troubleshooting.

For additional information, see [Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html) on the AWS website or contact us on the [AWS Quick Start Discussion Forum](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=178).

**Q.** I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS Cloudformation templates.

**A.** We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the location we&#39;ve provided or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer, you might encounter template size limitations when you create the stack. For more information about AWS CloudFormation limits, see the [AWS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html).
