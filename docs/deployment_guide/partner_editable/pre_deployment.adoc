//Include any predeployment steps here, such as signing up for a Marketplace AMI or making any changes to a partner account. If there are no predeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Predeployment steps

=== Prepare your AWS account

If you donâ€™t already have an AWS account, create one at
https://aws.amazon.com by following the on-screen instructions. Part of
the sign-up process involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN
using the phone keypad.
Use the region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region
where you want to deploy the Quick Start on AWS.

Choosing an AWS Region

[TIP]
Choose a Region closest to your data center or
corporate network to reduce network latency between systems running on
AWS and the systems and users on your corporate network.

Also, note that your choice of Region determines whether the Quick
Start deploys network address translation (NAT) gateways or NAT instances for network connections. For
a list of Regions that support NAT gateways, see
http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/[Amazon VPC pricing].

Create a http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[key
pair] in your preferred Region. To do this, in the navigation pane of
the Amazon EC2 console, choose *Key Pairs*, *Create Key Pair*, type a
name, and then choose *Create*.

*Creating a key pair*

Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login
information. To log in to your instances, you must create a
key pair. With Windows instances, a key pair is used to obtain the
administrator password through the Amazon EC2 console and then log in using
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), as explained in the
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide]. When using
Linux, a key pair is used to authenticate Secure Shell (SSH) login.
